### Steps

A map was created using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

* The markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.
* The popups were included that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
* A legend was created that provide context for the map data.
